# Imdb-Rating-Analysis-Visualization-and-statistical-analysis-
This project is my second data science project to analyze the Imdb Rating using Python. The Python libraries used were matplotlib, Pandas, seaborn, and Scipy(stats, pearsonr, oneway, and ttest). I also carried out the statistical analysis.
